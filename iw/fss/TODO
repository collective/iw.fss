* Include migration script "Original storage -> FSS". See ATCT2FSS in

  Note that the migration script may use the zcml.patchedTypesRegistry.

* Include migration script "FSS -> original storage" to provide iw.fss
  removal support.

* Add checksum to be sure files are not corrupted on filesystem.

* The "storage-strategy" should be mandatory and not implicitely
  "flat" in plone-filesystemstorage.conf.

* Deprecate the "flat" storage strategy (may be removed in FSS 2.8 or
  2.9).
